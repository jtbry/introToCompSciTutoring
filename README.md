# introCompSciTutoring
The folder titled introToCompSciTutoring is a Gradle project aimed at helping tutors and tutees understand content from ITSC 1212 and ITSC 1213 at UNC Charlotte. This project was developed as a tutor resource for the University Center for Academic Excellence (UCAE) at UNC Charlotte.

The project is created with IntelliJ but should be relatively easy to open with an editor/IDE of your choice and has been tested with VSCode and NetBeans. Please reach out to jbryan76@uncc.edu if you are having trouble importing it.

# Project Structure
## Main
The `main` package has only the Main.java file. This file will only run the examples to demonstrate their output allowing you to explain what is happening or change values. I reccomend stepping through the examples with a debugger to understand what is happening line by line.

## Examples
The `examples` package contains classes named after the topic they cover. Each class has a handful of examples covering the topic and should be used to get an understanding of what the topic is or how to work with it in Java.

## Exercises
The `exercises` package has exercises to be completed in order to demonstrate understanding of the concept. You should complete the provided methods following the directions given in the `TODO` comment. You may check your answers using the existing JUnit unit tests or creating your own.

# Conclusion
Please feel free to reach out to jbryan76@uncc.edu for suggestions or concerns. All contributions are welcomed, if you submit changes through the UCAE Tutor Material forms please also try to keep the [Github Repo](https://github.com/jtbry/introToCompSciTutoring) up to date as well.
